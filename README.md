# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The goal of this task is to explore the characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers present in a dataset. I gained insights into the data through visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps. This repository contains the code and visualizations for the task of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on a dataset using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the World Population Dataset. It contains population data from 1970 to 2022 for countries around the world. The dataset provides insights into population trends over time

## Dependencies
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Elements
- Line Plot of DataFrame
